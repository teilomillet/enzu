Document: Evaluation Frameworks for AI Systems

Rigorous evaluation is essential for understanding AI capabilities and limitations.
This document outlines frameworks for assessing AI safety and performance.

Connection to Safety:
Evaluation directly supports the safety goals in ai_safety_overview.txt by
providing evidence about system behavior. Without good evaluation, we cannot
verify alignment claims.

Framework Categories:

1. Capability Evaluations
   - Measure what the system can do
   - Benchmarks: MMLU, HumanEval, etc.
   - Dangerous capability detection (biosecurity, cyber)

2. Alignment Evaluations  
   - Measure whether the system does what we want
   - Tests for reward hacking (see reward_modeling_paper.txt)
   - Sycophancy and deception detection

3. Robustness Evaluations
   - Adversarial inputs
   - Distribution shift
   - Edge cases

Red Teaming:
Expert adversarial testing is critical. Red teams attempt to elicit harmful
behavior, find jailbreaks, and identify failure modes. Results feed into
the governance processes described in governance_framework.txt.

Metrics:
- Refusal rate on harmful requests
- Helpfulness on benign requests
- Consistency across phrasings
- Calibration of uncertainty

Challenges:
- Goodhart's law: optimizing for metrics degrades underlying goals
- Evaluations become stale as models improve
- Need for continuous, adaptive evaluation

Recommendations:
- Combine automated and human evaluation
- Use held-out test sets
- Regular third-party audits (see governance_framework.txt)
