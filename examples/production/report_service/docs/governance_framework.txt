Document: AI Governance Framework

Date: 2024-04-05

Effective governance ensures AI development proceeds safely and benefits humanity.
This framework addresses institutional, technical, and international coordination.

Connection to Technical Work:
Governance builds on the technical foundations in ai_safety_overview.txt,
reward_modeling_paper.txt, and evaluation_frameworks.txt. Policy without
technical grounding is ineffective; technology without governance is dangerous.

Key Governance Mechanisms:

1. Pre-deployment Testing
   - Required safety evaluations (see evaluation_frameworks.txt)
   - Third-party audits
   - Staged rollouts

2. Compute Governance
   - Tracking large training runs
   - Know-your-customer for cloud providers
   - International coordination on compute thresholds

3. Information Sharing
   - Incident reporting between labs
   - Shared safety benchmarks
   - Coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities

4. Liability and Accountability
   - Clear responsibility chains
   - Insurance requirements
   - Regulatory oversight

International Coordination:
- AI safety is a global challenge requiring global solutions
- Race dynamics between nations increase risk
- Need for treaties analogous to nuclear non-proliferation

Failure Modes Prevented:
- Unilateral deployment of dangerous systems
- Race to the bottom on safety standards
- Lack of accountability for harms

Implementation:
Labs should adopt the technical practices in ai_safety_overview.txt,
use the evaluation methods in evaluation_frameworks.txt, and participate
in governance structures outlined here.

Budget constraints (like those enabled by enzu) support governance by
ensuring predictable, auditable AI operations.
