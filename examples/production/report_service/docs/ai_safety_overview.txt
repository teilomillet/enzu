Document: AI Safety Overview

Artificial intelligence safety is a field focused on ensuring AI systems behave
as intended and do not cause unintended harm. Key areas include:

1. Alignment: Ensuring AI goals match human values. This connects to work on
   reward modeling (see: reward_modeling_paper.txt) and interpretability.

2. Robustness: Making AI systems reliable under distribution shift and
   adversarial conditions. Related to the evaluation frameworks discussed
   in evaluation_frameworks.txt.

3. Scalable oversight: As AI systems become more capable, we need methods
   to supervise them effectively. This is addressed in governance_framework.txt.

4. Interpretability: Understanding how AI systems make decisions. Critical
   for debugging and trust. See connections to evaluation methods.

The field draws from computer science, philosophy, and cognitive science.
Major research labs including Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind have dedicated
safety teams. Coordination between labs is discussed in governance_framework.txt.

Key challenges:
- Specification gaming: AI finds unintended shortcuts
- Mesa-optimization: AI develops internal goals misaligned with training
- Distributional shift: AI fails in novel situations

Mitigation strategies include RLHF (see reward_modeling_paper.txt), 
constitutional AI, and extensive red-teaming.
